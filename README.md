# Card-Probability-Calculator
This is a work-in-progress card probability calculator in Python by Hayden Mai & Benley Hsiang.

It is a collaborative project inspired by wanting to further explore how a deck of cards works and how probabilities may contribute to a prediction.

Based on everything we learned in **CMPT 120** (Intro to CS & Programming), **CMPT 125** (Intro to CS & Programming II) and **CMPT 210** (Probability & Computing) at Simon Fraser University.

## Game Info
You are guessing the next card of the deck! The game will show you the values of the card, but hide the suit of the card.

Presented with the probabilities of the next card & single attribute probabilities of the card, it's your role to successfully guess the next card!
- +10 for a correct guess
- +5 for a partially correct guess
- 0 for incorrect guess

Enjoy!
## Goals
- [x] 52 cards deck generation
- [x] Very basic probabilities output & data storage
- [x] Probability calculator using both card attributes & combinatorics 
- [ ] Repeatable user inputs
- [ ] Point system
- [ ] Non-digits detection

## How to Download & Run
To download the file,
1. To download, click on "guessing-game.py" for the game or "cardgencalc.py" for the card generation code.
2. Click on the 3 dots near the top right and click "Download" or alternatively, `Ctrl` + `Shift` + `S` to download the file.
3. Have fun!

To run the file, you will need Python 3, which can be found at https://www.python.org/downloads/.
