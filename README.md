# Card-Probability-Calculator
This is a work-in-progress card probability calculator in Python by Hayden Mai & Benley Hsiang.

It is a collaborative project inspired by wanting to further explore how a deck of cards works and how probabilities may contribute to a prediction.

Based on everything we learned in **CMPT 120** (Intro to CS & Programming), **125** (Intro to CS & Programming II) & **210** (Probability & Computing) at Simon Fraser University.

## Goals
- [x] 52 cards deck generation
- [x] Very basic probabilities output & data storage
- [ ] Advanced probability calculator using both card attributes
- [ ] Allow user to guess what card is next (game)
